# Marketing Automation & Operations Manager
## 🟢 Salary

Full-Time | Remote | $3,000/month (+ Bonus)

## 🟢 About Us

KodjoEnglish helps French-speaking Africans master English online so they can land better jobs, get promoted, travel freely, and speak confidently with natives — without feeling embarrassed. Our coaching program has already helped over 10,000 francophones in 60+ countries, and we're on a mission to impact 100,000+ lives over the next 5 years.

## 🟢 The Role

We're looking for a Marketing Automation & Operations Manager who's equal parts systems thinker, automator, and tech-savvy hustler. You're someone who can plug into a fast-moving team, wear multiple hats, and get stuff done across the entire marketing stack. This is a high-leverage, backend marketing role — focused on automation, tracking, building, optimizing, and reporting. You're a jack of all trades, and proud of it. You know how to move between tools, workflows, and systems like it's second nature — and you're obsessed with efficiency and scale.

## 🟢 Tools You'll Be Working With

Automation 👉🏼 Zapier, Make (Integromat), GoHighLevel
CRM / Email / Funnels 👉🏼 ActiveCampaign, Kajabi, SamCart, GoHighLevel
Data / Analytics 👉🏼 Airtable, Hyros, Google Sheets, TypeForm
Communication 👉🏼 FrontApp, Slack, Telegram, GoHighLevel

## 🟢 What You'll Be Doing

Build and manage automations across the full funnel
Track leads, conversions, and attribution with Hyros, Airtable, Sheets
Build and optimize landing pages and funnels (GoHighLevel, Kajabi, SamCart)
Create email automations, nurture sequences, and behavioral flows
Scale our newsletter: list growth, engagement, performance tracking
Build reporting dashboards for all key marketing metrics
Integrate tools and ensure clean data flow between them
Document your systems and maintain them like a pro
Collaborate with team leads to implement marketing campaigns faster
Always ask: "Can this be automated?" — and then make it happen

## 🟢 You'll be reporting to the CEO directly. 

You'll be working alongside content and marketing teammates, but you'll be the core owner of the systems behind it all.

## 🟢 You're a Fit If You…

Are fluent in both English and French
Have 3+ years experience in marketing ops, automation, or technical marketing roles
Can confidently build in Zapier, Make, Kajabi, GoHighLevel, ActiveCampaign, etc.
Know how to tag, segment, route, and track leads across multiple platforms
Are fluent in CRM logic, webhooks, triggers, and behavior-based flows
Love documenting your systems, fixing broken pipes, and keeping things running
Are comfortable jumping between tasks and wearing multiple hats
Want to work in a small, ambitious team and make a huge impact
Bonus: You have experience with edtech/digital coaching programs and you are a freak in the Sheets (Google Sheets that is 😂)

## 🟢 Test Task (for Shortlisted Candidates)

As part of the hiring process, you'll complete a mini tech challenge: "Build a basic funnel in GoHighLevel, integrate it with an ActiveCampaign email automation, and show us how you'd track the entire flow in Airtable or Google Sheets."

This helps us see how you think and build

## 🟢 Salary

✔️ $3,000/month + target-based bonus

## 🟢 Perks

100% remote, flexible work schedule
Work directly with the CEO — your impact is instant
Contribute to a meaningful mission helping people unlock global opportunities
Full ownership of your systems and processes — no micromanagement
Freedom to recommend new tools or kill inefficient ones

If you're a systems builder, automation lover, and tech-savvy operator — this is your playground.
